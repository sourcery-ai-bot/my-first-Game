Got the code from https://thehelloworldprogram.com/python/python-game-rock-paper-scissors/


This is a program that runs in the terminal. 
This particular Rock paper scissors game is a 4-way game.
The Player(User) is prompted to choose one object from the three objects listed.
The 4th outcome is the "tie", which means the computer and the user input was the same
